# MSIS549-Machine-Learning-Artificial-Intelligence
This repository stores my assignments and labs from the graduate curriculum - Machine Learning And Artificial Intelligence For Business Applications (MSIS 549).

Assignment 1: Multi-class classification problem on Reuters Newswires Dataset. How to encode labels and solve a multi-class classification problem? How to avoid overfitting with epoch selection? How to adjust Dense Layer and Hidden Layer to improve model performance? Why is it important to have having sufficiently large intermediate layers

Assignment 2: Convolution Neural Network (CNN) problem on Rock/Paper/Scissors Gesture Image Dataset. How to build a fully connect model and a CNN model to achieve best prediction on test data? 

Assignment 3: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) problem on Reuters Newswires Dataset. How to build a fully connect model and a RNN model to achieve best prediction on test data? Why are RNN layers (LSTM, GRU) more powerful? Can pre-trained word embedding help improve the model prediction?
